# Project: Uncertainty Quantification with Ensembles and Transformers

This repository contains the code used for the experiments described in the following paper:

üëâ [Overleaf Paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qxtrwqmtstvs#ce76dd)

> **Note**: The code may not run directly due to the absence of some necessary files (e.g., stored results), but it provides a valuable reference for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### 1. Simulation Experiments

#### ‚Ä¢ `data/`
Contains the code for generating synthetic datasets used in simulations.

#### ‚Ä¢ `models/`
Implements three types of models for uncertainty quantification.

#### ‚Ä¢ `train/` and `utils/`
Includes training scripts and helper functions.

#### ‚Ä¢ `visualization/`
Code for visualizing the results of simulation experiments.

#### ‚Ä¢ `epi.ipynb` & `OOD.ipynb`
- `epi.ipynb`: Trains and evaluates models for **epistemic uncertainty quantification**.
- `OOD.ipynb`: Evaluates models on **out-of-distribution (OOD) detection**.

#### ‚Ä¢ `vis/`
Supplementary scripts for visualizing model behavior.

### 2. Real-World Experiments

This part includes experiments on **six public datasets**:

- **IMDB**
- **Yelp**
- **RCT**
- **MIMIC-III (mortality prediction)**
- **Wafer**
- **ECG5000**

These datasets are publicly available and can be downloaded online.

#### ‚Ä¢ IMDB
- `IMDB.ipynb`: Uses BERT + Ensemble to quantify uncertainty.

#### ‚Ä¢ Yelp
- `yelp.ipynb`: Uses BERT + Ensemble for uncertainty quantification.

#### ‚Ä¢ RCT
- `RCT.ipynb`: Uses BERT + Ensemble to model uncertainty in RCT classification.

#### ‚Ä¢ MIMIC-III
- `models/`: Contains transformer-based ensemble model code.
- See `mimic3.md` for detailed instructions.

#### ‚Ä¢ Time Series (Wafer & ECG5000)
- Scripts to apply ensemble methods for uncertainty quantification in time-series data.
